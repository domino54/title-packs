All ManiaScript libraries written by Dommy for ManiaPlanet gaming system. Files include sources of ShootMania Galaxy pack game modes and libraries used by TrackMania² Pursuit game mode. Feel free to use them for your projects, but remember to credit me in your final work.

⚠️ **Note:** TrackMania² Pursuit game mode is closed source. Don't bother asking for its source, unless you plan a large, one-time event that would run on this mode.
